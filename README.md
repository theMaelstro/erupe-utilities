# erupe-utilities
Collection of scripts and tools wrote by me for Erupe.

Delete User From database and clean Database (database_delete_user.psql)
Currently supports deletion of one user at time.

METHOD 1
1. Open pgAdmin4 
2. Open PSQL Tool (IMPORTANT: Not Query Tool)
3. Copy and paste query (its CLI interface, don't worry about it being split in lines)
4. Hit enter
5. If you get only erupe=# as a result it means it worked. Otherwise errors will show up.

METHOD 2
1. Use com connection like PUTTY and connect to erupe using PSQL directly
2. Login as privileged  user.
3. Continue steps 3 onward from method 1
